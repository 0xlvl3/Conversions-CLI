# Conversions-CLI

*Currently still creating this CLI program.*

This program Conversions-CLI is a simple command-line application that generates random conversion problems for the user to solve. The user is given a randomly generated value for one unit of measurement and asked to convert it to another unit of measurement. The user's score is tracked and displayed at the end of the game.


### Currently Supported Conversions 
1. Time 
- Years => Days
